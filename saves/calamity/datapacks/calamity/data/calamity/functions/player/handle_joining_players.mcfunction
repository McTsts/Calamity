# Let's first check to see if any online player has left the game
# If a player fails the initial check in this function, they are no longer registered.
# Player has left the game and their SessionID does not match the current one. Let's reset them.

#   have been reset since then. Calamity often hard resets data, but this doesn't apply to offline
#   players.
